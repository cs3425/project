### Now that you have seen many full research projects saved online as GitHub repositories do you plan to use GitHub 
for your future projects as a way to store code and data in the cloud and to share your progress with others?
I think Github is great because once you know it, it's very easy to navigate and understand. This really aids collaboration and I know for 
that reason it's pretty ubiquitous among people and scientists who do work like this. I also think it's a neat way for less experienced 
programmers to get experience working on a bigger project that might be asking for input. It makes a neat community for a lot of different
levels to work together. Certainly if I ever find myself doing this kind of work for a thesis or grad school, Github's convenience and 
professionalism will come in handy. 

### Did you project accomplish the goals that you set out for yourself in your proposal? 
If not, why? What was the hardest problem in your project that were able to overcome? 
What, if any, was a problem that you were unable to overcome in your project within the given time?
I struggled a lot with coming up with what is useful and attainable from a scientific standpoint with the data I chose -- especially since
I chose in in part because of its workability. I had far more complex visualization in mind but did not think that wrangling the data 
and rearranging it would be such an integral part. I definitely did not expect to spend most of my time manipulating the dataframes 
and figuring out how to make it workable with my vision. Ultimately the visualization that I ended up doing was less than I had expected 
to be able to do, but struggling with it showed me where to change my expectations. 

### Do you feel that you've learned the skills necessary perform data analysis in Python, 
and to write your own program or pipeline for data analysis? What skills do you think you need to work on further, 
and where would you look to find more information about learning these skills?

I think in any language, it's pretty quick to learn how to apply data analysis tools to a simple and straightforward data set. I think for 
a lot of situations, this is generally fine. But there is certainly a large learning curve in going from that to handling any problem for 
any type of data. I think this project showed me that I can have an idea or plan of what it would make sense to do with data, and executing
it in a way that makes sense on a computer is a whole other question. There's this intermediate thought that has to happen between the 
abstract "this is what I want to get from some data" and the code of it -- that intermediate step I think requires a lot of exposure both
on a programatic side and also a scientific side. These are things I think I will continue to develop, especially from looking at other 
people's work and reading papers with more attention to the methodology and analysis.
