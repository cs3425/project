I looked at the following projects for this code review:
Anika: Neighbor-effect of N-fixing trees; Meredith: Resistance surfaces; Julia: Acoustic detector

### In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?
Some of the readme's were easier to read than others -- formatting can aid a lot in conveying the organization of the project. Some of the READMEs include more or less background information and explanation on the project. I think this helps a lot with professionality but isn't necessary for installation directions. My README does a fine job for installation and organizational overview. 

### Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?
Most of the repos I looked at were appropriately organized and easy to follow the flow of directory, but in the three that I looked at I only saw .ipynb files in the `project` directory, rather than a .py script. This may have been the result of misunderstanding. I followed the notebooks fine but did not find a script file to look through. 

### Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?
Some of the notebooks looked like they were just a repetition of the same files included in the `project` directory (see above), but still did a good job of demonstrating the tools and flow, but don't demonstrate loading their own package and demonstrating using the .py file written elsewhere. To be fair, this is really hard and confusing.

### Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?
Looking at the organization & READMEs helped with organizing my own repo and seeing what made sense from an outside perspective, especially in terms of installation instructions.
